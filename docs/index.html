              <h1>Moonsun Ale Co.</h1>
              <h6>Developed Company Site</h6>
              <p>Moonsun Ale Company is a website that was designed by my sister, Grace Evans. You can find more of her graphic design and branding/logo work at her website itsjustgrace.com. This company is fictitious and the site was only developed so that I could practice building a live site from a mockup in a Photoshop/Illustrator file. Therefore, some of the buttons that seem to give you the ability to buy anything are not functional. This is an example of what I can help you build if you have an idea of a site that you want to create for yourself or your company.</p>

              <h1>Coffee Shop Index</h1>
              <h6>Developed Utility Site</h6>
              <p>Coffee Shop Index is a website that was a personal idea that I had and went to build. The problem I looked to solve in building this site is that whenever I traveled somewhere or to a new city, I always want to go to the best coffee shops in the area.  Itâ€™s always hard to get from Yelp or random travel sites which ones are actually specialty/third wave shops and that makes it difficult to decide which to visit. I used the Google Maps Javascript API in building this site and was able to use that to plot points on a map of the US for people to be able to find shops.</p>
