                              <p>This weather app is a project I made for a class I took at Code Louisville. The class was 'Javscript with React.js'
                              and this React App I created starting with create-react-app. In this app I wanted to dispay appealing visuals and
                              simplistic design. Additionally, I wanted to use pastel tones that were pleasing and animations that made the app
                              more interesting than a static page. I still have a few things to add as far as functionality goes with this project, however,
                              I think it gives a lot to my portfolio and was worth adding.</p>

                              <h6>Company Info Site</h6>
                              <p>Moonsun Ale Company is a website that was a design by my sister, Grace Evans. You can find more of her graphic design and branding/logo work at her website itsjustgrace.com. This company is fictitious and the site
                                   was only developed so that I could practice building a live site from a mockup in a Photoshop/Illustrator file. Therefore, some of the buttons that seem to give you the ability to buy anything are not functional.
                                   This is an example of what I can help you build if you have an idea of a site that you want to create for yourself or your company.</p>

                              <h6>Coffee Shop Resource Site</h6>
                              <p>Coffee Shop Index is a website that was a personal idea that I had and went to build. The problem I looked to solve in building this site is that whenever I traveled somewhere or to a new city, I always want to go to
                                   the best coffee shops in the area. Itâ€™s always hard to get from Yelp or random travel sites which ones are actually specialty/third wave shops and that makes it difficult to decide which to visit. I used the Google
                                   Maps Javascript API in building this site and was able to use that to plot points on a map of the US for people to be able to find shops.</p>
